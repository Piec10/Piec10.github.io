  project1:
    description: Web application for managing projects created by many users
    details: "An application created for educational purposes, modeled on such software as Jira or Trello. It allows to create projects, add issues to them and manage them: 
              different priority levels, editing, closing a completed issue. It allows to add multiple users with different access levels to the project. 
              The application uses a MySQL database. Responsive frontend ensures proper display also on mobile devices."

  project2:
    description: Software for creating and editing 3D shapes, which are used for generating instructions for CNC bending machine

    details: "An application created to work with a CNC bending machine that I build. The g-code for more complex shapes is virtually impossible to write by hand, so I needed software to do it for me."

    details2: "Input data can be read from a file containing a list of 3D points, it is also possible to manually add segments. An interesting option for editing is the ability to interpolate 3D points to densify the geometry and produce a smoother bend profile. 
              Machine geometry parameters and generated g-code options can be configured. To ensure high accuracy of bending, the software allows you to enter compensation values for various angles, which is necessary
              due to the springiness of the material. The 3D view of the generated shape facilitates editing, and the ability to display bending animation allows you to check for possible errors and collisions with the machine."
